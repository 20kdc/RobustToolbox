https://f95zone.to/threads/the-underworld-full-game-private-build.12823/post-12462688 quotes a post by the user greendrake1188, that post being https://f95zone.to/goto/post?id=12462065 .
That post has since been deleted by greendrake1188, but it is clearly evident it used to exist. Furtermore, https://cdn.spacestationmultiverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image.png is a screenshot of the post.
This post is a clear and obvious violation of open-source morals, declaring forking a project (into Space Station Multiverse, that is free and open-source) to be "stealing" and wanting Skyedra "ruined".
In addition to this, there are screenshots of Jezithyr admitting to making the post available at https://spacestationmultiverse.com/2024/03/jesse-rougeau-jezithyr-game-cracking-threat-an-open-letter-to-ss14-leadership/ .
Wizard's Den, please stop defaming Skyedra while claiming she's defaming Jezithyr unless you can back up your words. The burden of proof is on you.
